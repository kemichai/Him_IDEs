# Him_ides - Himalayan Intermediate-Depth earthquakes

Description
------------
Set of codes (Python and GMT) for reproducing the results and plots from the manuscript titled
"Spatio-Temporal Evolution of Intermediate-Depth 
Seismicity Beneath the Himalayas: Implications for 
Metamorphism and Tectonics" published in 
Frontiers [link](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2021.742700/full).

How to run the codes
------------
For some brief instructions on how to run the Python codes see [here](python/README.md).

And for the GMT codes [here](gmt/README.md).


Note
------------
Codes here only reproduce our results in the specific publication.
For different applications the codes will need to be modified.
