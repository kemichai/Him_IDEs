# Him_ides - Himalayan Intermediate-Depth earthquakes

Description
------------
This repository includes scripts (Python and GMT) for reproducing the plots from the manuscript titled
["Spatio-Temporal Evolution of Intermediate-Depth Seismicity Beneath the Himalayas: Implications for 
Metamorphism and Tectonics"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2021.742700/full).

In this work, we apply a state-of-the-art earthquake detection techniques, starting from continuous waveform data, to examine the intermediate-depth seismicity characteristics beneath the central Himalayas (southeastern Tibet).

How to run the codes
------------
For the Python scripts click [here](python/README.md).
For the GMT scripts click [here](gmt/README.md).

Note
------------
Codes here solely reproduce our results in the specific publication.
For different applications the codes will need to be modified.
